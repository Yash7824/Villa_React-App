                    <h2>
                        Mount Batur Trek
                    </h2>

                    <p className="card-text">Bali is probably one of the few places in the world where you can climb up the
                        face of a live volcano, to reach the top of the crater. Mount Batur volcano is one of the most
                        sacred mountains in Bali. But what makes the trek even more special is that you can actually
                        trek the terrain in the cover of darkness, to arrive at the summit at daybreak. The sunrise from
                        the peak of Mount Batur looks absolutely breathtaking, with mists shrouding the lush green
                        landscape and lake Batur visible as a blue mirror to the sky. While some take the trek as a
                        challenge, others climb Batur to enjoy the view. About 1.5 hours from the slopes of the mountain
                        to the top, you would be able to view the sunrise and the Lombok island from a distance. The
                        caldera of Mount Batur is populated and includes the four main villages of Kedisan, Songan,
                        Trunyan and Toya Bungkah.</p>

                    <h2>
                        White Water Rafting
                    </h2>
                    <p className="card-text">This is one of the best adventure activities in Bali for the adventure
                        enthusiasts. You would descend through a lush tropical forest to the heart of the Ayung River,
                        discover hidden waterfalls and enjoy a swim in pristine waters and gain an insight into the
                        river ecology with the help of guides. The course of the river takes you through paddy fields,
                        small villages and also passes local Balinese temples, with carved cliff faces on either side.
                        It is really an experience worth remembering, due to the sheer diversity of the terrain you can
                        pass through. The Ayung river is also the longest river on the island of Bali. It can be
                        considered the best white water river rafting experience in Bali – the perfect place for
                        beginners or the family looking for some fun! Bali not only has the ocean surrounding it, but
                        also lots of options for river rafting within the island.</p>
